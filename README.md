This exercise is part of the Backend Roadmap series from roadmap.sh.  
In this case, I've build up a Personal Blog Webapp to practice templating, filesystem operations, basic authentication, form handling, and rendering HTML pages from the server. 
User can authenticate as Admin or as Standard. Depending on the role, they can make different actions on the blog articles.
